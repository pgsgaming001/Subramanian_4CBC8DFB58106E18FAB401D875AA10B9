#Here's a Python fu#Here's a Python function called `sort_students` that takes a list of student objects and sorts them based on their CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) in descending order:

#python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll_number, cgpa):
        self.name = name
        self.roll_number = roll_number
        self.cgpa = cgpa

def sort_students(student_list):
    sorted_students = sorted(student_list, key=lambda student: student.cgpa, reverse=True)
    return sorted_students


# Create a list of student objects
students = [
    Student("aruna ", "A001", 3.9),
    Student("Smiley", "A002", 3.7),
    Student("aruna.j", "A003", 4.0),
    Student("Angry bird", "A004", 3.8)
]

# Sort the students based on CGPA
sorted_students = sort_students(students)

# Print the sorted list of students
for student in sorted_students:
    print(f"Name: {student.name}, Roll Number: {student.roll_number}, CGPA: {student.cgpa}"
         )
